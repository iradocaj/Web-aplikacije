		<h2>Next Dodge Challenger Might Be Electrified, Says FCA Boss</h2>
		<p>The Detroit News reports that the next Dodge Challenger will get an electric boost.</p>
		<p>In an interview with the publication, CEO Mike Manley said the current platform will be get swapped for new lightweight technologies that should make room for electrification. Early speculators suggest FCA's 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with electric boost will make its way underhood of Dodge's base Challenger, which should start at around $30,000.</p>	
		<p>But don't think the Challenger is alone. Ford, we know, is adding a Mustang-based electric SUV to its lineup. The Corvette, too, will go hybrid with the arrival of the mid-engined "Zora" sometime this year. Rumor has it the electrified mid-engined Corvette could produce up to 1,000 horsepower (745 kilowatts).</p>
